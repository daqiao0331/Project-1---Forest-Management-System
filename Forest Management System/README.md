# Forest Management System

A modular, interactive forest management and analysis system with a modern Python Tkinter GUI. This project allows you to manage trees and paths, simulate infection spread, detect reserves, analyze forest data, and visualize the forest structure with advanced layouts.

## Features
- **Modern GUI**: Intuitive Tkinter interface for all operations
- **Tree & Path Management**: Add, delete, and modify trees and paths
- **CSV Import/Export**: Load and save forest data in CSV format
- **Shortest Path**: Find and visualize the shortest path between trees
- **Infection Simulation**: Simulate and animate infection spread
- **Reserve Detection**: Detect and highlight forest reserves
- **Data Analysis**: Visualize health, species, and reserve statistics with matplotlib
- **Advanced Layouts**: Force-directed and MDS layouts, with edge lengths reflecting CSV distances
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests for all core modules
