# Forest Management System

This project is a simple Forest Management System implemented in Python. It allows you to manage forests and trees, perform queries, and get statistics about the forest data. The code is modular and easy to extend for educational or demonstration purposes.

- `forest.py`: Defines the Forest class and methods to manage forests and their trees.
- `tree.py`: Defines the Tree class and its properties.
- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions for querying and statistics, such as filtering trees by health or counting tree species.
- `main.py`: The entry point of the program, demonstrating how to use the modules to manage forests and trees.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for each module to ensure correctness.

This project is suitable for learning object-oriented programming and basic software engineering concepts.
